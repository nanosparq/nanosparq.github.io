Abstract = {Electronic switches based on the migration of high-density point
   defects, or memristors, are poised to revolutionize post-digital
   electronics. Despite significant research, key mechanisms for filament
   formation and oxygen transport remain unresolved, hindering our ability
   to predict and design device properties. For example, experiments have
   achieved 10 orders of magnitude longer retention times than predicted by
   current models. Here, using electrical measurements, scanning probe
   microscopy, and first-principles calculations on tantalum oxide
   memristors, we reveal that the formation and stability of conductive
   filaments crucially depend on the thermodynamic stability of the
   amorphous oxygen-rich and oxygen- poor compounds, which undergo
   composition phase separation. Including the previously neglected effects
   of this amorphous phase separation reconciles unexplained discrepancies
   in retention and enables predictive design of key performance indicators
   such as retention stability. This result emphasizes non-ideal
   thermodynamic interactions as key design criteria in post-digital
   devices with defect densities substantially exceeding those of today's
   covalent semiconductors.},
