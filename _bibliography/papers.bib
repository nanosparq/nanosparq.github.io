Abstract = {Electronic switches based on the migration of high-density point
   defects, or memristors, are poised to revolutionize post-digital
   electronics. Despite significant research, key mechanisms for filament
   formation and oxygen transport remain unresolved, hindering our ability
   to predict and design device properties. For example, experiments have
   achieved 10 orders of magnitude longer retention times than predicted by
   current models. Here, using electrical measurements, scanning probe
   microscopy, and first-principles calculations on tantalum oxide
   memristors, we reveal that the formation and stability of conductive
   filaments crucially depend on the thermodynamic stability of the
   amorphous oxygen-rich and oxygen- poor compounds, which undergo
   composition phase separation. Including the previously neglected effects
   of this amorphous phase separation reconciles unexplained discrepancies
   in retention and enables predictive design of key performance indicators
   such as retention stability. This result emphasizes non-ideal
   thermodynamic interactions as key design criteria in post-digital
   devices with defect densities substantially exceeding those of today's
   covalent semiconductors.},

Abstract = {Tunable electronic materials that can be switched between different
   impedance states are fundamental to the hardware elements for
   neuromorphic computing architectures. This ``brain-like{''} computing
   paradigm uses highly paralleled and colocated data processing, leading
   to greatly improved energy efficiency and performance compared to
   traditional architectures in which data have to be frequently
   transferred between processor and memory. In this work, we use scanning
   microwave impedance microscopy for nanoscale electrical and electronic
   characterization of two-dimensional layered semiconductor PdSe2 to probe
   neuromorphic properties. The local resolution of tens of nanometers
   reveals significant differences in electronic behavior between and
   within PdSe2 nanosheets (NSs). In particular, we detected both n-type
   and p-type behaviors, although previous reports only point to ambipolar
   n-type dominating characteristics. Nanoscale capacitance-voltage curves
   and subsequent calculation of characteristic maps revealed a hysteretic
   behavior originating from the creation and erasure of Se vacancies as
   well as the switching of defect charge states. In addition, stacks
   consisting of two NSs show enhanced resistive and capacitive switching,
   which is attributed to trapped charge carriers at the interfaces between
   the stacked NSs. Stacking n- and p-type NSs results in a combined
   behavior that allows one to tune electrical characteristics. As local
   inhomogeneities of electrical and electronic behavior can have a
   significant impact on the overall device performance, the demonstrated
   nanoscale characterization and analysis will be applicable to a wide
   range of semiconducting materials.},
