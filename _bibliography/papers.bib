Abstract = {Electronic switches based on the migration of high-density point
   defects, or memristors, are poised to revolutionize post-digital
   electronics. Despite significant research, key mechanisms for filament
   formation and oxygen transport remain unresolved, hindering our ability
   to predict and design device properties. For example, experiments have
   achieved 10 orders of magnitude longer retention times than predicted by
   current models. Here, using electrical measurements, scanning probe
   microscopy, and first-principles calculations on tantalum oxide
   memristors, we reveal that the formation and stability of conductive
   filaments crucially depend on the thermodynamic stability of the
   amorphous oxygen-rich and oxygen- poor compounds, which undergo
   composition phase separation. Including the previously neglected effects
   of this amorphous phase separation reconciles unexplained discrepancies
   in retention and enables predictive design of key performance indicators
   such as retention stability. This result emphasizes non-ideal
   thermodynamic interactions as key design criteria in post-digital
   devices with defect densities substantially exceeding those of today's
   covalent semiconductors.},

Abstract = {Tunable electronic materials that can be switched between different
   impedance states are fundamental to the hardware elements for
   neuromorphic computing architectures. This ``brain-like{''} computing
   paradigm uses highly paralleled and colocated data processing, leading
   to greatly improved energy efficiency and performance compared to
   traditional architectures in which data have to be frequently
   transferred between processor and memory. In this work, we use scanning
   microwave impedance microscopy for nanoscale electrical and electronic
   characterization of two-dimensional layered semiconductor PdSe2 to probe
   neuromorphic properties. The local resolution of tens of nanometers
   reveals significant differences in electronic behavior between and
   within PdSe2 nanosheets (NSs). In particular, we detected both n-type
   and p-type behaviors, although previous reports only point to ambipolar
   n-type dominating characteristics. Nanoscale capacitance-voltage curves
   and subsequent calculation of characteristic maps revealed a hysteretic
   behavior originating from the creation and erasure of Se vacancies as
   well as the switching of defect charge states. In addition, stacks
   consisting of two NSs show enhanced resistive and capacitive switching,
   which is attributed to trapped charge carriers at the interfaces between
   the stacked NSs. Stacking n- and p-type NSs results in a combined
   behavior that allows one to tune electrical characteristics. As local
   inhomogeneities of electrical and electronic behavior can have a
   significant impact on the overall device performance, the demonstrated
   nanoscale characterization and analysis will be applicable to a wide
   range of semiconducting materials.},

Abstract = {Inspired by biological neuromorphic computing, artificial neural
   networks based on crossbar arrays of bilayer tantalum oxide memristors
   have shown to be promising alternatives to conventional complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) architectures. In order to understand
   the driving mechanism in these oxide systems, tantalum oxide films are
   resistively switched by conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM), and
   subsequently imaged by kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and
   spatially resolved time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
   (ToF-SIMS). These workflows enable induction and analysis of the
   resistive switching mechanism as well as control over the resistively
   switched region of the film. In this work it is shown that the resistive
   switching mechanism is driven by both current and electric field
   effects. Reversible oxygen motion is enabled by applying low (<1 V)
   electric fields, while high electric fields generate irreversible
   breakdown of the material (>1 V). Fully understanding oxygen motion and
   electrical effects in bilayer oxide memristor systems is a fundamental
   step toward the adoption of memristors as a neuromorphic computing
   technology.},

   TaOx toward electroforming-free neuromorphic functions},
Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {123},
Number = {15},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Resistive switching in thin films has been widely studied in a broad
   range of materials. Yet, the mechanisms behind electroresistive
   switching have been persistently difficult to decipher and control, in
   part due to their non-equilibrium nature. Here, we demonstrate new
   experimental approaches that can probe resistive switching phenomena,
   utilizing amorphous TaOx as a model material system. Specifically, we
   applied scanning microwave impedance microscopy and cathodoluminescence
   (CL) microscopy as direct probes of conductance and electronic
   structure, respectively. These methods provide direct evidence of the
   electronic state of TaOx despite its amorphous nature. For example, CL
   identifies characteristic impurity levels in TaOx, in agreement with
   first principles calculations. We applied these methods to investigate
   He-ion-beam irradiation as a path to activate conductivity of materials
   and enable electroforming-free control over resistive switching.
   However, we find that even though He-ions begin to modify the nature of
   bonds even at the lowest doses, the films' conductive properties exhibit
   remarkable stability with large displacement damage and they are driven
   to metallic states only at the limit of structural decomposition.
   Finally, we show that electroforming in a nanoscale junction can be
   carried out with a dissipated power of <20 nW, a much smaller value
   compared to earlier studies and one that minimizes irreversible
   structural modifications of the films. The multimodal approach described
   here provides a new framework toward the theory/experiment guided design
   and optimization of electroresistive materials.},

Abstract = {Recent emergence of low-dimensional unconventional superconductors and
   their exotic interface properties calls for new approaches to probe the
   pairing symmetry, a fundamental and frequently elusive property of the
   superconducting condensate. Here, we introduce the unique capability of
   tunneling Andreev reflection (TAR) to probe unconventional pairing
   symmetry, utilizing the sensitivity of this technique to specific
   Andreev reflections. Specifically, suppression of the lowest-order
   Andreev reflection due to quantum interference but emergence of the
   higher-order Andreev processes provides direct evidence of the
   sign-changing order parameter in the paradigmatic FeSe superconductor.
   TAR spectroscopy also reveals two superconducting gaps, points to a
   possibility of a nodal gap structure, and directly confirms that
   superconductivity is locally suppressed along the nematic twin boundary,
   with preferential and near-complete suppression of the larger energy
   gap. Our findings therefore enable new, atomic-scale insight into
   microscopic, inhomogeneous, and interfacial properties of emerging
   quantum materials.},

Abstract = {The Abisko project aims to develop an energy-efficient spiking neural
   network (SNN) computing architecture and software system capable of
   autonomous learning and operation. The SNN architecture explores novel
   neuromorphic devices that are based on resistive-switching materials,
   such as memristors and electrochemical RAM. Equally important, Abisko
   uses a deep codesign approach to pursue this goal by engaging experts
   from across the entire range of disciplines: materials, devices and
   circuits, architectures and integration, software, and algorithms. The
   key objectives of our Abisko project are threefold. First, we are
   designing an energy-optimized high-performance neuromorphic accelerator
   based on SNNs. This architecture is being designed as a chiplet that can
   be deployed in contemporary computer architectures and we are
   investigating novel neuromorphic materials to improve its design.
   Second, we are concurrently developing a productive software stack for
   the neuromorphic accelerator that will also be portable to other
   architectures, such as field-programmable gate arrays and GPUs. Third,
   we are creating a new deep codesign methodology and framework for
   developing clear interfaces, requirements, and metrics between each
   level of abstraction to enable the system design to be explored and
   implemented interchangeably with execution, measurement, a model, or
   simulation. As a motivating application for this codesign effort, we
   target the use of SNNs for an analog event detector for a high-energy
   physics sensor.},

Abstract = {Polarization dynamics in ferroelectric materials is governed by the
   effective potential energy landscape of the order parameter. The unique
   aspect of ferroelectrics compared to many other transitions is the
   possibility of more than two potential wells, leading to complicated
   energy landscapes with new fundamental and functional properties. Here,
   direct dynamic evidence is revealed of a triple-well potential in the
   metal thiophosphate Sn2P2S6 compound using multivariate scanning probe
   microscopy combined with theoretical simulations. The key finding is
   that the metastable zero polarization state can be accessed through a
   gradual switching process and is stabilized over a broad range of
   electric fields. Simulations confirm that the observed zero polarization
   state originates from a kinetic stabilization of the nonpolar state of
   the triple-well, as opposed to domain walls. Dynamically, the
   triple-well of Sn2P2S6 becomes equivalent to antiferroelectric
   hysteresis loops. Therefore, this material combines the robust and
   well-defined domain structure of a proper ferroelectric with dynamic
   hysteresis loops present in antiferroelectrics. Moreover, the
   triple-well enhances mem-capacitive effects in Sn2P2S6, which are
   forbidden for ideal double-well ferroelectrics. These findings provide a
   path to tunable electronic elements for beyond binary high-density
   computing devices and neuromorphic circuits based on dynamic properties
   of the triple-well.},

Abstract = {New pathways to controlling the morphology of superconducting vortex
   lattices-and their subsequent dynamics-are required to guide and scale
   vortex world-lines into a computing platform. We have found that the
   nematic twin boundaries align superconducting vortices in the adjacent
   terraces due to the incommensurate potential between vortices
   surrounding twin bounda-ries and those trapped within them. With the
   varying density and morphology of twin boundaries, the vortex lattice
   assumes several distinct structural phases, including square, regular,
   and irregular one-dimensional lattices. Through concomitant analysis of
   vortex lattice models, we have inferred the characteristic energetics of
   the twin boundary potential and furthermore predicted the existence of
   geometric size effects as a function of increasing confinement by the
   twin boundaries. These findings extend the ideas of directed control
   over vortex lattices to intrinsic topological defects and their
   self-organized networks, which have direct implications for the future

Abstract = {Smart electronic circuits that support neuromorphic computing on the
   hardware level necessitate materials with memristive, memcapacitive, and
   neuromorphic- like functional properties; in short, the electronic
   response must depend on the voltage history, thus enabling learning
   algorithms. Here we demonstrate volatile ferroelectric switching of
   Sn2P2S6 at room temperature and see that initial polarization
   orientation strongly determines the properties of polarization
   switching. In particular, polarization switching hysteresis is strongly
   imprinted by the original polarization state, shifting the regions of
   non-linearity toward zero-bias. As a corollary, polarization switching
   also enables effective capacitive switching, approaching the
   sought-after regime of memcapacitance. Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire
   simulations demonstrate that one mechanism by which polarization can
   control the shape of the hysteresis loop is the existence of charged
   domain walls (DWs) decorating the periphery of the repolarization
   nucleus. These walls oppose the growth of the switched domain and favor
   back-switching, thus creating a scenario of controlled volatile
   ferroelectric switching. Although the measurements were carried out with
   single crystals, prospectively volatile polarization switching can be
   tuned by tailoring sample thickness, DW mobility and electric fields,
   paving way to non-linear dielectric properties for smart electronic
   circuits.},

   solving the LGD equations in a Galilean frame moving with the wall
   velocity v. Thermal noise plays a key role in the wall depinning process
   at small fields E. We study the scaling of the velocity v with the
   applied DC electric field E and show that noise and spatial disorder
   strongly affect domain wall velocities. We also show that domain walls
   develop a local, metastable paraelectric region and widen significantly
   in the presence of thermal noise in materials with ``multiwell ``
   potentials, representative of ferroelectrics at temperatures T just
   below a first-order phase transition (Curie) temperature Tc. These
   calculations point to the potential of noise and disorder to become
   control factors for the switching properties of ferroelectric materials,
   for example for advancement of microelectronic applications.},

Abstract = {Ferroelectric domain walls have emerged as one of the most fascinating
   objects in condensed matter physics due to the broad variability of
   functional behaviors they exhibit. However, the vast majority of domain
   walls studies have been focused on bias-induced dynamics and transport
   behaviors. Here, the scanning probe microscopy approach based on
   piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) with a dynamically heated probe,
   combining local heating and local biasing of the material is introduced.
   This approach is used to explore the thermal polarization dynamics in
   soft Sn2P2S6 ferroelectrics, and allows for the exploration of phase
   transitions at individual domain walls. The strong and weak modulation
   regimes for the thermal PFM are introduced. The future potential
   applications of heated probe approach for functional SPM measurements
   including piezoelectric, elastic, microwave, and transport measurements
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Out-of-plane polarized ferroelectric materials in a capacitive structure
   provide a key component for several technological applications.
   Furthermore, two-dimensional materials are expected to aid in the quest
   for both ultrathin and flexible electronics. Of the various
   two-dimensional ferroelectrics with out-of-plane polarization, CuInP2S6
   is special in that the Cu atoms are highly mobile and it has been shown
   to possess both low- and high-polarization states. Using
   density-functional-theory calculations, we explore the stabilization of
   the ferroelectric state for several prototypical metal contacts (Gr, Ni,
   Cu, Au, and Ag). In all cases, we find that the ferroelectric state can
   be stabilized at fewer layers than in the freestanding case. For all of
   the considered conventional metal contacts, we also find the existence
   of a quasi-ferroelectric state that stabilizes a polar phase for
   thicknesses greater than two layers of CIPS. In the cases of Au and Ag,
   interfacial alignment and strain can be used to stabilize
   ferroelectricity at the bilayer limit. Furthermore, we find that the
   strength of the interaction between the contact and CuInP2S6 also leads
   to stabilization of the high-polarization state when ferroelectricity is
   stabilized. Lastly, energy-barrier calculations show that the system is
   still switchable in the presence of contact doping from the metal
   contacts.},

Abstract = {Characterizing the novel properties of layered van der Waals materials
   is key for their application in functional devices. A better
   understanding of this type of material requires correlative imaging of
   diverse nanoscale material properties. Within this class of materials,
   CuInP2S6 (CIPS) has received a significant degree of interest due to its
   ionically mediated room temperature ferroelectricity. Moreover, it is
   possible to form stable self-assembled heterostructures of ferroelectric
   CuInP2S6 (CIPS) and non-ferroelectric (i.e., lacking Cu) In4/3P2S6 (IPS)
   phases, by controlling the targeted composition and kinetics of
   synthesis. In this work, we present a correlative nanometric imaging
   study of the phononic modes and piezoelectricity of the phase-separated
   thin heteroepitaxial CIPS/IPS flakes. We show that it is possible to
   isolate the different phononic modes of the two phases by spatially
   correlating them with their distinct ferroelectric behavior. The
   coupling of our experimental data with unsupervised learning statistical

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Rapid proliferation of hyperspectral imaging in scanning probe
   microscopy creates unique opportunities to systematically capture and
   categorize higher dimensional datasets, toward insights into electronic,
   mechanical, and chemical properties of materials with nano- and
   atomic-scale resolution. Effective hyperspectral imaging requires a
   consistent framework for data analysis that would be broadly applicable,
   reproducible, and transferrable, conceptually resembling the success of
   integral transforms in image analysis. Here, we demonstrate application
   of similarity learning for resolving the structure of tunneling
   spectroscopy data, characterizing a superconducting material with sparse
   density of defects. Popular methods for unsupervised learning and
   discrete representation of the data in terms of clusters of
   characteristic behaviors were found to produce inconsistencies with
   respect to capturing the location and tunneling characteristics of
   defect sites. The underlying reason for their ambiguity was traced to
   continuous variation of the electronic properties across the surface and
   therefore the absence of clear structural boundaries in the
   low-dimensional latent spaces of the data. We supported this hypothesis
   by direct analysis of the distributions of Euclidean distances within
   the dataset. We further proposed distance rescaling with probabilistic
   description as a possible approach to mitigate the detrimental effect of
   the long tails of the distributions on the performance of clustering
   methods. Subsequently, we applied a more general, nonlinear similarity
   learning, where dimension reduction was explicitly trained to amplify
   similarities and dissimilarities among individual spectra. This approach
   was found to outperform several widely used methods for dimensionality
   reduction and produce a clear categorization of tunneling spectra.
   Significant spectral weight transfer associated with the electronic
   reconstruction by the vacancy sites was systematically captured, as was
   the spatial extent of the vacancy region. Given that a great variety of
   electronic materials will exhibit similarly smooth variation of spectral
   response due to random or engineered inhomogeneities, we believe our
   approach will be useful for systematic analysis of hyperspectral imaging
   with minimal prior knowledge as well as prospective comparison of
   experimental measurements with theoretical calculations with explicit
   consideration of disorder.},

Abstract = {Antiferroelectric (AFE) materials, in which alternating dipole moments
   cancel out to a zero net macroscopic polarization, can be used for
   high-density energy storage and memory applications. The AFE phase can
   exist in bulk CuInP2Se6, CuBiP2S6, and a few other transition-metal
   thiophosphates below 200 K. The required low temperature poses
   challenges for practical applications. In this work, we report the
   coexistence of ferrielectric (FE) states and a stable surface phase that
   does not show piezoelectric response ({''}zero-response phase{''}) in
   bulk CuInP2S6 at room temperature. Using piezoresponse force microscopy
   (PFM) tomographic imaging together with density functional theory, we
   find that direct and alternating voltages can locally and stably convert
   FE to zero-response phases and vice versa. While PFM loops show pinched
   hystereses reminiscent of antiferroelectricity, PFM tomography reveals
   that the zero-response areas form only on top of the FE phase in which
   the polarization vector is pointing up. Theoretical calculations suggest
   that the zero-response phase may correspond to AFE ordering where
   stacked CuInP2S6 layers have alternating polarization orientations
   thereby leading to a net-zero polarization. Consistent with experimental
   findings, theory predicts that the FE polarization pointing down is
   robust up to the top surface, whereas FE polarization pointing up
   energetically favors the formation of an AFE surface layer, whose
   thickness is likely to be sensitive to local strains. AFE order is
   likely to be more robust against detrimental size effects than polar
   order, therefore providing additional opportunities to create
   multifunctional heterostructures with 2D electronic materials.},

Abstract = {The van der Waals layered material CuInP2S6 features interesting
   functional behavior, including the existence of four uniaxial
   polarization states, polarization reversal against the electric field
   through Cu ion migration, a negative-capacitance regime, and reversible
   extraction of Cu ions. At the heart of these characteristics lies the
   high mobility of Cu ions, which also determines the spontaneous
   polarization. Therefore, Cu migration across the lattice results in
   unusual ferroelectric behavior. Here, we demonstrate how the interplay
   of polar and ionic properties provides a path to ionically controlled
   ferroelectric behavior, achieved by applying selected DC voltage pulses
   and subsequently probing ferroelectric switching during fast triangular
   voltage sweeps. Using current measurements and theoretical calculations,
   we observe that increasing DC pulse duration results in higher ionic
   currents, the buildup of an internal electric field that shifts
   polarization loops, and an increase in total switchable polarization by
   similar to 50\% due to the existence of a high polarization phase which
   is stabilized by the internal electric field. Apart from tuning
   ferroelectric behavior by selected square pulses, hysteretic
   polarization switching can even be entirely deactivated and reactivated,
   resulting in three-state systems where polarization switching is either
   inhibited or can be performed in two different directions.},

Abstract = {Ferroelectric materials exhibit spontaneous polarization that can be
   switched by electric field. Beyond traditional applications as
   nonvolatile capacitive elements, the interplay between polarization and
   electronic transport in ferroelectric thin films has enabled a path to
   neuromorphic device applications involving resistive switching. A
   fundamental challenge, however, is that finite electronic conductivity
   may introduce considerable power dissipation and perhaps destabilize
   ferroelectricity itself. Here, tunable microwave frequency electronic
   response of domain walls injected into ferroelectric lead zirconate
   titanate (PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3) on the level of a single nanodomain is
   revealed. Tunable microwave response is detected through first-order
   reversal curve spectroscopy combined with scanning microwave impedance
   microscopy measurements taken near 3 GHz. Contributions of film
   interfaces to the measured AC conduction through subtractive milling,
   where the film exhibited improved conduction properties after removal of
   surface layers, are investigated. Using statistical analysis and finite
   element modeling, we inferred that the mechanism of tunable microwave
   conductance is the variable area of the domain wall in the switching
   volume. These observations open the possibilities for ferroelectric
   memristors or volatile resistive switches, localized to several tens of
   nanometers and operating according to well-defined dynamics under an
   applied field.},

   spectroscopy},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},
Number = {20},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Microwave measurements have recently been successfully applied to
   measure ferroelectric materials on the nanoscale, including detection of
   polarization switching and ferroelectric domain walls. Here we discuss
   the question of whether scanning probe microscopy operating at microwave
   frequency can identify the changes associated with the soft phonon
   dynamics in a ferroic. The analytical expressions for the electric
   potential, complex impedance, and dielectric losses are derived and
   analyzed, since these physical quantities are linked to experimentally
   measurable properties of the ferroic. As a ferroic we consider virtual
   or proper ferroelectric with an optic phonon mode that softens at a
   Curie point. We also consider a decay mechanism linked to the
   conductance of the ferroic, thus manifesting itself as the dielectric
   loss in the material. Our key finding is that the influence of the soft
   phonon dispersion on the surface potential distribution, complex
   impedance, and dielectric losses are evidently strong in the vicinity
   (similar to 10-30 K) of the Curie temperature. Furthermore, we
   quantified how the spatial distribution and frequency spectra of the
   complex impedance and the dielectric losses react on the dynamics of the
   soft phonons near the Curie point. These results set the stage for
   characterization of polar phase transitions with nanoscale microwave
   measurements, providing a complementary approach to well established
   electromechanical measurements for fundamental understanding of
   ferroelectric properties as well as their applications in
   telecommunication and computing.},

Title = {Oxygen Vacancy Injection as a Pathway to Enhancing Electromechanical
   Response in Ferroelectrics},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Since their discovery in late 1940s, perovskite ferroelectric materials
   have become one of the central objects of condensed matter physics and
   materials science due to the broad spectrum of functional behaviors they
   exhibit, including electro-optical phenomena and strong
   electromechanical coupling. In such disordered materials, the static
   properties of defects such as oxygen vacancies are well explored but the
   dynamic effects are less understood. In this work, the first observation
   of enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films is reported
   driven via dynamic local oxygen vacancy control in piezoresponse force
   microscopy (PFM). A persistence in peizoelectricity past the bulk Curie
   temperature and an enhanced electromechanical response due to a created
   internal electric field that further enhances the intrinsic
   electrostriction are explicitly demonstrated. The findings are supported
   by a series of temperature dependent band excitation PFM in ultrahigh
   vacuum and a combination of modeling techniques including finite element
   modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory. This
   study shows the pivotal role that dynamics of vacancies in complex
   oxides can play in determining functional properties and thus provides a
   new route toward- achieving enhanced ferroic response with higher
   functional temperature windows in ferroelectrics and other ferroic
   materials.},

Abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) is a valuable technique for reconstructing
   measurements in numerous domains. CS has not yet gained widespread
   adoption in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), despite potentially
   offering the advantages of lower acquisition time and enhanced tolerance
   to noise. Here we applied a simple CS framework, using a weighted
   iterative thresholding algorithm for CS reconstruction, to
   representative high-resolution STM images of superconducting surfaces
   and adsorbed molecules. We calculated reconstruction diagrams for a
   range of scanning patterns, sampling densities, and noise intensities,
   evaluating reconstruction quality for the whole image and chosen
   defects. Overall, we find that typical STM images can be satisfactorily
   reconstructed down to 30\% sampling-already a strong improvement. We
   furthermore outline limitations of this method, such as sampling pattern
   artifacts, which become particularly pronounced for images with
   intrinsic long-range disorder, and propose ways to mitigate some of
   them. Finally, we investigate compressibility of STM images as a measure
   of intrinsic noise in the image and a precursor to CS reconstruction,
   enabling a priori estimation of the effectiveness of CS reconstruction
   with minimal computational cost.},

Abstract = {Using the Landau-Devonshire approach and available experimental results,

   which varies from prolate needles to oblate disks. We also revealed the
   strong influence of a mismatch strain, elastic stress, and shape
   anisotropy on the phase diagrams and polar properties of a nanoscale

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NANOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Memristor devices have been extensively studied as one of the most
   promising technologies for next-generation non-volatile memory. However,
   for the memristor devices to have a real technological impact, they must
   be densely packed in a large crossbar array (CBA) exceeding Gigabytes in
   size. Devising a selector device that is CMOS compatible, 3D stackable,
   and has a high non-linearity (NL) and great endurance is a crucial
   enabling ingredient to reach this goal. Tunneling based selectors are
   very promising in these aspects, but the mediocre NL value limits their
   applications in large passive crossbar arrays. In this work, we
   demonstrated a trilayer tunneling selector based on the
   Ge/Pt/TaN1+x/Ta2O5/TaN1+x/Pd layers that could achieve a NL of 3 x
   10(5), which is the highest NL achieved using a tunnel selector so far.
   The record-high tunneling NL is partially attributed to the bottom
   electrode's ultra-smoothness (BE) induced by a Ge/Pt layer. We further
   demonstrated the feasibility of 1S1R (1-selector 1-resistor) integration
   by vertically integrating a Pd/Ta2O5/Ru based memristor on top of the
   proposed selector.},

Abstract = {The dependence of electromechanical behavior on strain in ferroelectric

   such as the Curie temperature. For van der Waals materials, a unique
   opportunity arises because of wrinkling, bubbling, and Moire phenomena
   accessible due to structural properties inherent to the van der Waals
   gap. Here, we use piezoresponse force microscopy and unsupervised
   machine learning methods to gain insight into the ferroelectric
   properties of layered CuInP2S6 where local areas are strained in-plane
   due to a partial delamination, resulting in a topographic bubble
   feature. We observe significant differences between strained and
   unstrained areas in piezoresponse images as well as voltage
   spectroscopy, during which strained areas show a sigmoid-shaped response
   usually associated with the response measured around the Curie
   temperature, indicating a lowering of the Curie temperature under
   tensile strain. These results suggest that strain engineering might be
   used to further increase the functionality of CuInP2S6 through locally
   modifying ferroelectric properties on the micro- and nanoscale.},

Abstract = {Negative capacitance (NC) provides a path to overcome the Boltzmann
   limit that dictates operating voltages in transistors and, therefore,
   may open up a path to the challenging proposition of lowering energy
   consumption and waste heat in nanoelectronic integrated circuits.
   Typically, NC effects in ferroelectric materials are based on either
   stabilizing a zero-polarization state or slowing down ferroelectric
   switching in order to access NC regimes of the free-energy distribution.
   Here, a fundamentally different mechanism for NC, based on CuInP2S6, a
   van der Waals layered ferrielectric, is demonstrated. Using density
   functional theory and piezoresponse force microscopy, it is shown that
   an unusual combination of high Cu-ion mobility and its crucial role in
   determining polarization magnitude and orientation (P) leads to a
   negative slope of the polarization versus the electric field E,dP/dE <
   0, which is a requirement for NC. This mechanism for NC is likely to
   occur in a wide class of materials, offering new possibilities for
   NC-based devices. The nanoscale demonstration of this mechanism can be
   extended to the device-level by increasing the regions of homogeneous
   polarization and polarization switching, for example, through strain
   engineering and carefully selected electric field pulses.},

Abstract = {Topological defects in materials present unique opportunities for
   nanoelectronics, as they allow us to harness new functionalities
   unavailable in the pristine bulk. However, their study in layered and 2D
   materials has traditionally been limited to grain boundaries and
   dislocations present in individual layers. A promising layered metal
   thiophosphate system, CuInP2S6 (GIPS), exhibits a wide range of
   functionalities, including ferrielectricity, that are strongly affected
   by its layered nature and the existence of the van der Waals gap. Here,
   we explore the landscape of nanoscale topological and point defects
   affecting layer stacking via high-resolution scanning transmission
   electron microscopy in cross-sectional form. We show the presence of
   topological defects, such as edge dislocations, where an additional CIPS
   layer is inserted and abruptly terminates, as well as domain walls and
   kinks with high areal density. We find evidence for nanodomains that
   span multiple layers and observe that the presence of the defects is
   weakly correlated with the presence of domain boundaries. These studies
   confirm the rich nature of defect structures in layered materials and
   suggest opportunities for novel device architectures beyond the
   single-layer electronics paradigm.},

Abstract = {CuInP2S6 (CIPS) is a van der Waals material that has attracted attention
   because of its unusual properties. Recently, a combination of density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations and piezoresponse force microscopy
   (PFM) showed that CIPS is a uniaxial quadruple-well ferrielectric
   featuring two polar phases and a total of four polarization states that
   can be controlled by external strain. Here, we combine DFT and PFM to
   investigate the stress-dependent piezoelectric properties of CIPS, which
   have so far remained unexplored. The two different polarization phases
   are predicted to differ in their mechanical properties and the stress
   sensitivity of their piezoelectric constants. This knowledge is applied
   to the interpretation of ferroelectric domain images, which enables
   investigation of local strain and stress distributions. The interplay of
   theory and experiment produces polarization maps and layer spacings
   which we compare to macroscopic X-ray measurements. We found that the
   sample contains only the low-polarization phase and that domains of one
   polarization orientation are strained, whereas domains of the opposite
   polarization direction are fully relaxed. The described nanoscale
   imaging methodology is applicable to any material for which the
   relationship between electromechanical and mechanical characteristics is
   known, providing insight on structural, mechanical, and
   electromechanical properties down to similar to 10 nm length scales.},

Abstract = {Polar van der Waals chalcogenophosphates exhibit unique properties, such
   as negative electrostriction and multi-well ferrielectricity, and enable
   combining dielectric and 2D electronic materials. Using low temperature
   piezoresponse force microscopy, we revealed coexistence of piezoelectric
   and non-piezoelectric phases in CuInP2Se6, forming unusual domain walls
   with enhanced piezoelectric response. From systematic imaging
   experiments we have inferred the formation of a partially polarized
   antiferroelectric state, with inclusions of structurally distinct
   ferrielectric domains enclosed by the corresponding phase boundaries.
   The assignment is strongly supported by optical spectroscopies and
   density-functionaltheory calculations. Enhanced piezoresponse at the
   ferrielectric/antiferroelectric phase boundary and the ability to
   manipulate this entity with electric field on the nanoscale expand the
   existing phenomenology of functional domain walls. At the same time,
   phase-coexistence in chalcogenophosphates may lead to rational
   strategies for incorporation of ferroic functionality into van der Waals
   heterostructures, with stronger resilience toward detrimental
   size-effects.},

   Ferroelectrics},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED},

Abstract = {Polarization in ferroelectrics can be switched in the direction of an
   applied electric field by dipole reorientation, enabling numerous
   applications and fundamental phenomena. Here, we demonstrate that, in
   the van der Waals (vdW) layered ferrielectric CuInP2S6, a unique
   mechanism exists where polarization aligns against the direction of the
   applied electric field, seemingly in violation of the fundamental
   properties of a dipolar solid. The mechanism is the result of the
   electric field driving the Cu atoms unidirectionally across the vdW
   gaps, which is distinctively different from dipole reorientation. The
   crossing of Cu atoms is the fundamental process of ionic conductivity,
   yet it is compatible with the existence of polarization. These phenomena
   are confirmed by nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy of ferroelectric
   capacitors, coupled with dynamic density-functional-theory simulations.
   The symbiotic relationship of ferroelectric and ionic phenomena enables
   alternative approaches to control polarization and necessitates a change
   in perspective on nucleation, domain-wall dynamics, and other
   ferroelectric and electromechanical characteristics in material systems
   where ionic and ferroelectric phenomena manifest.},

Abstract = {With the advent of increasingly elaborate experimental techniques in
   physics, chemistry and materials sciences, measured data are becoming
   bigger and more complex. The observables are typically a function of
   several stimuli resulting in multidimensional data sets spanning a range
   of experimental parameters. As an example, a common approach to study
   ferroelectric switching is to observe effects of applied electric field,
   but switching can also be enacted by pressure and is influenced by
   strain fields, material composition, temperature, time, etc. Moreover,
   the parameters are usually interdependent, so that their decoupling
   toward univariate measurements or analysis may not be straightforward.
   On the other hand, both explicit and hidden parameters provide an
   opportunity to gain deeper insight into the measured properties,
   provided there exists a well-defined path to capture and analyze such
   data. Here, we introduce a new, two-dimensional approach to represent
   hysteretic response of a material system to applied electric field.
   Utilizing ferroelectric polarization as a model hysteretic property, we
   demonstrate how explicit consideration of electromechanical response to
   two rather than one control voltages enables significantly more
   transparent and robust interpretation of observed hysteresis, such as
   differentiating between charge trapping and ferroelectricity.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate how the new data representation readily fits
   into a variety of machine-learning methodologies, from unsupervised
   classification of the origins of hysteretic response via linear
   clustering algorithms to neural-network-based inference of the sample
   temperature based on the specific morphology of hysteresis.},

Abstract = {Using a local real-space microscopy probe, we discover evidence of
   nanoscale interlayer defects along the c-crystallographic direction in

   122 atomic arrangements within the ab-plane, and within regions of

   substructure is very rigid, Ba ions are relatively weakly bound and can
   be displaced from the 122, forming stacking faults resulting in the
   physical separation of the 122 between adjacent ordered domains. The
   evidence for interlayer defects between the FeAs superconducting planes
   gives perspective on the minimal connection between interlayer chemical

   defects through a percolative path of the ordered layered 122 lattice

Abstract = {A material with reversible temperature change capability under an
   external electric field, known as the electrocaloric effect (ECE), has
   long been considered as a promising solid-state cooling solution.
   However, electrocaloric (EC) performance of EC materials generally is
   not sufficiently high for real cooling applications. As a result,
   exploring EC materials with high performance is of great interest and
   importance. Here, we report on the ECE of ferroelectric materials with
   van der Waals layered structure (CuInP2S6 or CIPS in this work in
   particular). Over 60\% polarization charge change is observed within a
   temperature change of only 10 K at Curie temperature. Large adiabatic
   temperature change (vertical bar Delta T vertical bar) of 3.3 K and
   isothermal entropy change (vertical bar Delta S vertical bar) of 5.8 J
   kg(-1) K-1 at vertical bar Delta E vertical bar = 142.0 kV cm(-1) and at
   315 K (above and near room temperature) are achieved, with a large EC
   strength (vertical bar Delta T vertical bar/vertical bar Delta E
   vertical bar) of 29.5 mK cm kV(-1). The ECE of CIPS is also investigated
   theoretically by numerical simulation, and a further EC performance

Title = {Giant negative electrostriction and dielectric tunability in a van der

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The interest in ferroelectric van der Waals crystals arises from the
   potential to realize ultrathin ferroic systems owing to the reduced
   surface energy of these materials and the layered structure that allows
   for exfoliation. Here, we quantitatively unravel giant negative
   electrostriction of van der Waals layered copper indium thiophosphate
   (CIPS), which exhibits an electrostrictive coefficient Q(33) as high as
   -3.2m(4)/C-2 and a resulting bulk piezoelectric coefficient d(33) up to
   -85 pm/V. As a result, the electromechanical response of CIPS is
   comparable in magnitude to established perovskite ferroelectrics despite
   possessing a much smaller spontaneous polarization of only a few mu
   C/m(2). In the paraelectric state, readily accessible owing to low
   transition temperatures, CIPS exhibits large dielectric tunability,
   similar to widely used barium strontium titanate, and as a result both
   giant and continuously tunable electromechanical response. The
   persistence of electrostrictive and tunable responses in the
   paraelectric state indicates that even few-layer films or nanoparticles
   will sustain significant electromechanical functionality, offsetting the
   inevitable suppression of ferroelectric properties in the nanoscale
   limit. These findings can likely be extended to other ferroelectric
   transition metal thiophosphates and (quasi-) two-dimensional materials,
   and might facilitate the quest toward alternative ultrathin functional
   devices incorporating electromechanical response.},

Abstract = {Polarization switching is a fundamental feature of ferroelectric
   materials, enabling a plethora of applications and captivating the
   attention of the scientific community for over half a century. Many
   previous studies considered ferroelectric switching as a purely physical
   process, whereas polarization is fully controlled by the superposition
   of electric fields. However, screening charge is required for
   thermodynamic stability of the single domain state that is of interest
   in many technological applications. The screening process has always
   been assumed to be fast; thus, the rate-limiting phenomena were believed
   to be domain nucleation and domain wall dynamics. In this manuscript, we
   demonstrate that polarization switching under an atomic force microscopy
   tip leads to reversible ionic motion in the top 3 nm of PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3
   surface layer. This evidence points to a strong chemical component to a
   process believed to be purely physical and has major implications for
   understanding ferroelectric materials, making ferroelectric devices, and
   interpreting local ferroelectric switching.},

Abstract = {Analytical description of domain structure morphology and phase diagrams
   of ferroelectric nanoparticles is developed in the framework of
   Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. To model realistic conditions of
   incomplete screening of spontaneous polarization at the particle
   surface, it was considered covered by an ultra-thin layer of screening
   charge with effective screening length. The phase diagrams, calculated
   for spherical Sn2P2S6 nanoparticles in coordinates ``temperature{''} and
   ``effective screening length{''} by finite element modelling,
   demonstrate the emergence of poly-domain region at the tricritical point
   and its broadening with increasing the screening length for the particle
   radius over a critical value. Metastable and stable labyrinthine domain
   structures exist in Sn2P2S6 nanoparticles with radius (8-10) nm and
   more. We derived simple analytical expressions for the boundaries
   between paraelectric, single-domain and poly-domain ferroelectric
   phases, tricritical point and the necessary condition for the appearance
   of labyrinthine domains, and demonstrated their high accuracy in
   comparison with finite element modelling results.
   Analytical expressions for the dependence of the
   ferroelectric-paraelectric transition temperature on the particle radius
   in the single-domain and poly-domain states of the particle were
   compared with analogous dependences experimentally measured for
   SrBi2Ta2O9 nanoparticles and simulated for Sn2P2S6 nanocrystals by Monte
   Carlo method within the framework of axial next-nearest-neighbours Ising
   model. The analytical expression for the ferroelectric-paraelectric
   transition temperature in the poly-domain state quantitatively agrees
   with experimental and simulated results, and it accurately reproduces
   empirical Ishikawa equation at all temperatures, justifying it
   theoretically. Analytical description shows that phase diagrams and
   domain morphologies, which are qualitatively similar to the ones
   calculated in this work, can be expected in other ferroelectric
   nanoparticles covered by the screening charges, being rather different
   for the ferroelectrics with the first and second order
   ferroelectric-paraelectric transitions respectively. (C) 2018 Acta

Abstract = {Metal thiophosphates are attracting growing attention in the context of
   quasi-two-dimensional van der Waals functional materials. Alkali
   thiophosphates are investigated as ion conductors for solid
   electrolytes, and transition-metal thiophosphates are explored as a new
   class of ferroelectric materials. For the latter, a representative
   copper indium thiophosphate is ferrielectric at room temperature and,
   despite low polarization, exhibits giant negative electrostrictive
   coefficients. Here, we reveal that ionic conductivity in this material
   enables localized extraction of Cu ions from the lattice with a biased
   scanning probe microscopy tip, which is surprisingly reversible. The
   ionic conduction is tracked through local volume changes with a scanning
   probe microscopy tip providing a current-free probing technique, which
   can be explored for other thiophosphates of interest. Nearly 90 nm-tall
   crystallites can be formed and erased reversibly on the surface of this
   material as a result of ionic motion, the size of which can be
   sensitively controlled by both magnitude and frequency of the electric
   field, as well as the ambient temperature. These experimental results
   and density functional theory calculations point to a remarkable
   resilience of CuInP2S6 to large-scale ionic displacement and Cu
   vacancies, in part enabled by the metastability of Cu-deficient phases.
   Furthermore, we have found that the piezoelectric response of CuInP2S6
   is enhanced by about 45\% when a slight ionic modification is carried
   out with applied field. This new mode of modifying the lattice of
   CuInP2S6, and more generally ionically conducting thiophosphates, posits
   new prospects for their applications in van der Waals heterostructures,
   possibly in the context of catalytic or electronic functionalities.},

Abstract = {The ability to control thin-film growth has led to advances in our
   understanding of fundamental physics as well as to the emergence of
   novel technologies. However, common thin-film growth techniques
   introduce a number of limitations related to the concentration of
   defects on film interfaces and surfaces that limit the scope of systems
   that can be produced and studied experimentally. Here, we developed an
   ion-beam based subtractive fabrication process that enables creation and
   modification of thin films with pre-defined thicknesses. To accomplish
   this we transformed a multimodal imaging platform that combines
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with atomic force
   microscopy to a unique fabrication tool that allows for precise
   sputtering of the nanometer-thin layers of material. To demonstrate
   fabrication of thin-films with in situ feedback and control on film
   thickness and functionality we systematically studied thickness
   dependence of ferroelectric switching of lead-zirconate-titanate, within
   a single epitaxial film. Our results demonstrate that through a
   subtractive film fabrication process we can control the piezoelectric
   response as a function of film thickness as well as improve on the
   overall piezoelectric response versus an untreated film.},

Abstract = {Atomic force microscopy is widely used for nanoscale characterization of
   materials by scientists worldwide. The long-held belief of ambient AFM
   is that the tip is generally chemically inert but can be functionalized
   with respect to the studied sample. This implies that basic imaging and
   scanning procedures do not affect surface and bulk chemistry of the
   studied sample. However, an in-depth study of the confined chemical
   processes taking place at the tip-surface junction and the associated
   chemical changes to the material surface have been missing as of now.
   Here, we used a hybrid system that combines time-of-flight secondary ion
   mass spectrometry with an atomic force microscopy to investigate the
   chemical interactions that take place at the tip-surface junction.
   Investigations showed that even basic contact mode AFM scanning is able
   to modify the surface of the studied sample. In particular, we found
   that the silicone oils deposited from the AFM tip into the scanned
   regions and spread to distances exceeding 15 mu m from the tip. These
   oils were determined to come from standard gel boxes used for the
   storage of the tips. The explored phenomena are important for
   interpreting and understanding results of AFM mechanical and electrical
   studies relying on the state of the tip-surface junction.},

Abstract = {Spectroscopic measurements of current-voltage curves in scanning probe
   microscopy is the earliest and one of the most common methods for
   characterizing local energy-dependent electronic properties, providing
   insight into superconductive, semiconductor, and memristive behaviors.
   However, the quasistatic nature of these measurements renders them
   extremely slow. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally new approach for
   dynamic spectroscopic current imaging via full information capture and
   Bayesian inference. This general-mode I-V method allows three orders of
   magnitude faster measurement rates than presently possible. The
   technique is demonstrated by acquiring I-V curves in ferroelectric
   nanocapacitors, yielding >100,000 I-V curves in <20 min. This allows
   detection of switching currents in the nanoscale capacitors, as well as
   determination of the dielectric constant. These experiments show the
   potential for the use of full information capture and Bayesian inference
   toward extracting physics from rapid I-V measurements, and can be used
   for transport measurements in both atomic force and scanning tunneling
   microscopy.},
